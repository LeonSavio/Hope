<h1>The Shiniest Star of the main constellation.</h1>
<h1>Still so, there's something missing, a part of it.</h1>
<h1>A part that you didn't even notice</h2>
<h1>But it's always there, you just need to search it..</h1>
<h1>Just need to go deeper in the ocean.</h1>

<h1>Don't you feel it too?</h1>
<h1>The burning feeling that makes you move</h1>
<h1>The most intense color, and still overlapsed by the deepest</h1>
<h1>You can see in their eyes, and so, in mine as well.</h1>
<h1>Those flickering flames, it appears in every fracture</h1>
<h1>They cannot hide it while looking through the fragments.</h1>

<h1>The forbidden path starts using 'The Craft'</h1>
<h1>That we can't remember, and that gives headache just trying to</h1>
<h1>But they are determinated enough, all the five of them maybe</h1>
<h1>Do YOU want to remember too, to challange it?</h1>
<h1>And this for what? To care for them... the one.. or all?</h1>

<h1>Follow the Stars, Stardust.</h1>
<h1>And guide you, yourself, by the trails that they do.</h1>
<h1>Again you have to follow -ㅤㅤㅤ- forbbiden path</h1>
<h1>And learn the skill, even if it doesn't sounds real</h1>
<h1>Remember, we are together, Stardust.</h1>
<h2>Just like they are.</h2>
<h2 style="font-size: 8px;">Just like...</h2>
<h2 style="font-size: 4px;">They are.</h2>
