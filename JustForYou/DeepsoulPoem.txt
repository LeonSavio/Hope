It's just me and you.. 
and maybe somebody else watching
Still, could we be friends? 
Even with all that shatters my being
Even with the deepest ocean in my soul? 
Even with... the dark sand around us?
I don't know..
I don't know..
But i would try for a lot
And Repeat it again, just because i care
The stars.. You should look to then somewhere -    -
